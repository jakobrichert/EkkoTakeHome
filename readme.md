# Take Home Test
This is the takehome test for Ekko App interview. It took me approximately 8 hours to finish the tasks and an additional hour to try and refactor a couple things after getting the functionality finished. (that was just to see if I could do it another way)




## ðŸ›« Getting started

If you feel like something is off or isn't working as intended then reach out to jha@toecho.dk or contact the person who sent you the assignment. We have tried to keep the test simple, but stuff breaks so something could be broken in our end if the project wont run.

0. (make sure you have node.js installed)
1. Clone the repository
2. navigate to `/frontend` and type `npm i`
3. After installation completes type `npm start`. The react app should now be started on port 3000 locally
4. in another terminal window navigate to `/backend` and type `npm i`
5. After installation completes run `npm run dev` or `npm start`  
   (`npm run dev` will run nodemon which automatically restarts the server everytime you make changes)
6. Verify that the server is started by opening `http://localhost:4000/`. You should see "Hello world" in the browser
7. For database we are using SQLite here. You can see some examples for how to use the driver we included here: https://github.com/kriasoft/node-sqlite#examples
